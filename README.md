# 126-Years-of-Historical-Olympic-Evolution

**Project Overview**: This project explores the evolution of the Summer Olympic Games from 1896 to 2024, focusing on how the Olympics have transformed in terms of gender representation, country performance, and event diversity over 126 years. Using a historical dataset from Kaggle, we conducted an in-depth analysis of athlete participation, medal counts, and the progression of various sports disciplines.

The Olympic Games, a symbol of global unity and cultural exchange, have grown into the premier international sporting event. Our project aims to uncover patterns and trends that define this evolution by leveraging interactive visualizations built in Tableau.
